Transparency stands as a foundational guideline, requiring businesses to articulate in their data policies the specifics of what data is collected and the purpose behind its collection. Honesty plays a pivotal role, ensuring that companies truthfully communicate their data collection practices and objectives. Relevancy is another crucial aspect, emphasizing the importance of collecting only pertinent data to minimize potential risks for customers.
